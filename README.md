I added my friends to Balatro. Or well, at least some of them!

## About:
Berry's Legendaries is a mod that adds (at the time of writing) 5 new **Legendaries** to spice up your game whenever you get **Soul**! They range from mildly interesting to potentially game breaking, and they're all mostly based on my friends and potential inside joke(r)s based on them.

There are currently a total of 5 Legendaries you can get, with more coming in eventual updates! What are their abilities? Get 'em and see!

## Downloads & Misc. Info:
- You'll need [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) for this. Preferably the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases)!
- Once you do, download the [latest release of the mod](), and then go to your Mods folder (`%appdata%/Balatro/Mods`) and drop it there. It should work properly if you see it enabled in your Mods tab!
- We've *attempted* to try and make this as mod compatible as we could, although this is not aiming to be the holy grail of compatibility. If there's any mod conflicts, we'll see what we can do, but as with the nature of mods ever-evolving, we can't promise it'll work well with everything!
- I am also *not* that good of a coder! This mod was made in part as a side project from me, and everybody else decided to chip in art and ideas and additional code, so if a lot of the internals look like it could have been done better... yeah! I think it could be! But this is my own coding adventure, and I'd like to learn by myself for the most part. (Although general pointers are appreciated!)

## Credits: 
- This mod was written by [TonyKrZa](https://github.com/TonyKrZa) (me!) and [Axyraandas](https://github.com/Axyraandas), with additional help from [fumiko_239](https://github.com/2394425147).

- Special thanks to [stickmancomic](https://ch.tetr.io/u/stickmancomic) for idea workshopping, and the tens of thousands of modders in the Balatro discord for your hard work in making this possible in the first place!

(These will be added in the Mod Credits in the game later when I learn how to do so!)
